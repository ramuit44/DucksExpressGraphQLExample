# GRAPHQL SERVER FOR BAMBOO #

The Graphql API interface layer for Bamboo. All the microservices API's of Bamboo are abstracted  via the graphql api. And information is fetched 
according to what the user(UI) wants.

This is the express version of the Appolo server for local development. For prod we would be using the lamda version of the Appolo sever.
